Automate M-Pesa USSD (*334#) flows on Android — Send Money, Paybill, Till Number, and Withdraw Cash. Fill the form, tap Run, and the app guides the USSD session for you.

**Strictly for personal use only.** Works fully offline; your M-Pesa PIN is stored securely on device only.

## Features

- **Transaction types**
  - Send Money (phone + amount)
  - Paybill (business + account + amount)
  - Till / Lipa na M-PESA (till number + amount)
  - Withdraw Cash (agent + store + amount)
- **Accessibility-driven automation** — reads the USSD menu and enters your choices.
- **Optional “Press 1 to confirm”** — app can send the final confirmation for you, then close the USSD screen after the result.
- **SMS trigger** — run USSD from allowed numbers by sending a formatted SMS (e.g. `SM|amount` for send money).
-

## Intended use

- **Personal use only** — not for commercial or shared use.
- **Best suited for older phones (under Android 12)** — where USSD automation is most practical.
- **Safest if used on a second phone with a second number** — a device and SIM you don’t use for daily banking, so exposure is limited.

---

## Requirements

- **Android 7.0 (API 24)** or higher
- **Accessibility permission** — you must enable “PesaMirror USSD Automation” in Settings → Accessibility so the app can automate the *334# dialog
- **Phone permission** — to dial *334#
- Optional: **SMS** and **Notifications** if you use the SMS trigger

## Build & run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/davidamunga/pesamirror.git
   cd pesamirror
   ```
2. Open in Android Studio (or use Gradle from the command line).
3. Build and run on a device or emulator:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```
   Install the APK from `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`, or run from Android Studio.

### Installing from an APK (side-loading)

If you install PesaMirror from a downloaded APK (e.g. from [Releases](https://github.com/davidamunga/pesamirror/releases)) rather than the Play Store, Android will block the install by default. You need to **allow installation from unknown sources** for the app you use to open the APK (browser, file manager, etc.):

- **Android 8+:** Settings → **Apps** → select the app (e.g. Chrome, Files) → **Install unknown apps** → turn **Allow from this source** on.
- **Older Android:** Settings → **Security** → enable **Unknown sources** (or **Install unknown apps**).

Then open the APK again and confirm **Install**.

## Usage

1. **First launch** — complete onboarding (you can skip), then enable PesaMirror in **Settings → Accessibility**.
2. **Set your M-Pesa PIN** in the app (stored encrypted on device).
3. Choose **transaction type**, fill the fields (phone/till/business/account/agent/store, amount).
4. Tap **Run** — the app dials *334# and automates the menu steps.
5. Optionally enable **SMS trigger** and add allowed sender numbers to run flows via SMS.

### SMS trigger format (from allowed senders only)

| Action        | Format                          |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
